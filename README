This work in progress is an attempt to bring some order in the chaos
of MCU vendor SDK.

The key idea is to make them fit into the same tree structure, and to
adopt a common project structure.

The target tree structure is populated with files extracted from
archives downloaded from each vendor's web site, or cloned from
some GitHub or Gitee repository.

Scripts take care of dispatching files in the appropriate places, 
convert character sets, and build libraries so each project doesn't 
need to also build its HAL. This allows to easily rebuild a chip's
SDK when it gets updated by its vendor.

Other scripts define environment variables for use in Makefiles.
Before running make, a specific command must be issued to properly
initialise the environment:

    eval "$(/my_install_dir/bin/configure-sdk MY_MCU)"

The blinky subdirectory contains project examples for each chip
tested so far.
