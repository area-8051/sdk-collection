To install, simply git clone into the directory of your choice, 
let's call it /my_install_dir.

The only thing you need to change is to set the value of the 
EMBEDDED_TOOLS_DIR variable in /my_install_dir/bin/configure-sdk 
to /my_install_dir.

Install the toolchain you need under /my_install_dir/toolchain, 
or with your package manager if your distribution provides it.

To see which MCU are already supported, list the content of 
/my_install_dir/lib.

To install the latest version of an MCU's SDK, run:
/my_install_dir/bin/build-sdk MY_MCU

To create a new project for an MCU, copy it's blinky and start from 
there: cp -r /my_install_dir/blinky/MY_MCU /my_project_dir
See the comments in its Makefile for a little help.

To build your project, open a shell and type:

    eval "$(/my_install_dir/bin/configure-sdk MY_MCU)"
    make
