CH32V103 serial flashing procedure:

- Connect a USB-to-serial adapter to the board: adapter RX to board PA9, 
adapter TX to board PA10. Power the board with a 3.3V supply.

- Launch WCHISPTool, select the "CH32Vx Series" tab, select Chip model, 
Download type, COM port and User file.

- On the board, hold the BOOT0 button down and press NRST.

- In WCHISPTool, click the "Download" button.

- If you want to enable further flashing with OpenOCD, 
click the "Remove Protect" button.

- Release the BOOT0 button and press the NRST button to start your firmware.

- Note: for this to work, the BOOT1 pin (= PB2) must be kept at a low 
level. This is the case on the WeAct BluePill+, as PB2 controls an LED 
connected to the ground.

To find this, I had to google "ch32v103串口下载" and the page describing 
the procedure was on the first page of results.
